  <h3>Good or Bad a comparison</h3>
  <p>This is the website I chose to compare my site too <a href="http://www.acaloriecounter.com/fast-food.php">Acaloriecounter</a></p>
  <p>What I feel of what make this site good judging by the source html, is that it looks very well made together. I guess me being new to all this makes it seem that way. Either way I love how well organize it is. It Really helps me look into this and find what I need it to compare to my website.
  <p> I also, have to add that theres a lot of indention on their website. I'm not to sure if thats good practice or not. I will ask on my next GPS session.</p> 
  <p>Now I can say my website is still lacking in a few aspect. One I notice from the other webiste I link is that they use more commands such as "col" "div" etc. I suppose I could go back into my code and reorganize it. However, since this is just for practice I'll take notes on this and add it to my next project in order for someone else to look through my HTML and not have a headache.</p>
